<h3>Customer Churn Prediction.</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to differentiate between reliable and unreliable customers i.e. whether a customer will leave the bank in the near future or not.</p>

<p>To predict the customer churn rate three different models (individually) were created. They are Linear Regression model, Random Forest Tree Regressor model, and Artificial Neural Network model.</p>

<p>Accuracy of these models are:<p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Random Forest Tree Regressor= 88%</p></li>
  <li><p>Artificial Neural Network= 86%</p></li>
  <li><p>Linear Regression= 80%</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This dataset is available in Kaggle :</p>
