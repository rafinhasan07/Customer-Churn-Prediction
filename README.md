# Customer-Churn-Prediction
<h3>The purpose of this project is to differentiate between reliable and unreliable customers i.e. whether a customer will leave the bank in the near future or not.</h3>

To predict the customer churn rate three different models (individually) was created. They are Linear Regression model, Random Forest Tree Regressor model, and Artificial Neural Network model.

Accuracy of these models are:
1. Random Forest Tree Regressor= 88%
2. Artificial Neural Network= 86%
3. Linear Regression= 80%
